# Speech Commands Dataset
For this project, I used the _Speech Commands_Dataset_, a dataset created by the TensorFlow and AIY teams. The dataset has 65,000 one-second long utterances of 30 short words, by thousands of different people, contributed by members of the public through the AIY website. For more info and in order to download it, check out the official [website](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/08/launching-speech-commands-dataset.html).

To use the dataset, download the file and unzip the folders with the audio tracks here, in the dataset folder. Finally, remove this file from the folder.
